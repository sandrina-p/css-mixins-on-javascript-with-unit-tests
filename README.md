# CSS Mixins on JS with Unit Tests

A working example about the article I've written:  
[Power-up your CSS Mixins by writing them with Javascript](https://medium.com/p/825b41728a55/).


#### Advantages of writing CSS Mixins with JS
- Faster compilation time
- Prettier and advanced logic than the @if | @for | $list
- Access to values outside the CSS files
- Unit testing — yes, put your CSS to the proof!

Built with [Webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

## Usage

- `npm install`
- `npm start` - Demo at http://localhost:3000/
- `npm test` - run tests with Jest
